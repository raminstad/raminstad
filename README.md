## Greetings, Welcome to my Github ✌️
My name is Ramin and I am a Data Scientist, I have developed an immense passion for Data Science. I enjoy helping corporations and companies with analyzing their data and finding useful insights from it. 
I have experience working with these skills:
* Python
* Pandas
* R
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

In my life, I have traveled around the world ✈️, and have seen many different extravagant countries. I then attended William Jessup University and received my Bachelor’s in Science of biology 🧬. While attending William Jessup University I was in the Men’s Soccer team ⚽, and played four years. While in school I was a Sales development specialist at a car dealership and started doing analytical work. I was in control of  establishing clear performance and goals and metrics for revenue, customer service/ retention, and I designed sales and service strategies to improve revenue. I am extremely tech savvy, so after I finished my Bachelor’s I wanted to know the trends of technology within helping businesses make wise decisions for their futures, and making well informed model’s. 
I am fluent in Farsi and English. When I am not in class, or studying. I spend my time going on hikes with my golden retriever, spending time with family and friends, and creating new blog posts of Data Science and work on my projects. I feel like the true meaning of life is that it is never too late to pick up on a new passion.
